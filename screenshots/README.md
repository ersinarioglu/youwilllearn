# Screenshots Directory

This directory contains screenshots of the YouWillLearn application for documentation purposes.

When running the application, take screenshots of:
1. Home Page with video list
2. Video player page with comments
3. Add Video form

These screenshots should be saved as:
- home_page.png
- video_page.png
- add_video.png

Then update the main README.md to include these screenshots.
